## First, lets talk basics! 

*SELECT* : 

All SQL code will **ALWAYS** have SELECT AND FROM. For example:

```sql
SELCT
column1, #remeber to separate columns by ','
column2,
function calculation (such as CONCAT, SUM, AVG, etc.) #functions and concatination can also happen in this section
FROM table1
```
