Barred From Campus:
This script was written to get all the people that were barred from campus from the dataset. The purpose of this query was to get "do not contact" list, 
to make sure we never contact them through mail, email, and remove them from all subscriptions.

This information is then used to update our CRM, therefore setting all their contact preferences to 'No' .
